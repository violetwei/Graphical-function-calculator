# Graphical-function-calculator
This is a Java project I've written in Nov. 2017.

Designed a graphical user interface(GUI) that allows the user to key in an expression and have the result appear on a display with a menu item that controls the number of decimal places at the bottom of the screen.

Design of the GUI is greatly simplified by using the TableLayout manager, this allows to easily populate a grid with JButtons and JTextFields for creating the display.
